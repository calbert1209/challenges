  - 💬 I used CSS as that is what I am most comfortable with
    - I find it helpful to have all the styling in once place
- [x] Write a nice commit message and order it well.
  - 💬 I like to commit often, so each major change was its own PR, squash-merged to create a single commit
  - 💬 I left some comments in the PRs to show what I was thinking about. Please have a look.👀

## Bonuses Completed

- [x] Supporting different screen sizes (responsive).
  - 💬 The layout should work for screens as narrow as 280px.

## What's next

I've added some issues to this fork as a record of things I might handle next if this were a real project.

## Thank You!

This challenge was easy to start, as everything was really well prepared. I can tell your team has put
a lot of work into this. It is much more interesting to work on a project that mirrors real-life development work!
I had a lot of fun. 😁
